"""flagship.py -- chorus's operator-spine envelopes (status, doctor).

Honest by construction, mirroring the crucible lesson: the informational envelope
defaults to the operational token "OK", never a verdict token (MATCH/DRIFT/
UNVERIFIABLE) -- status and doctor measure nothing, so they must not render a
verdict. doctor resolves each capability's live entry point and reports
"available"/"absent", a diagnostic that can actually fail, never a hardcoded pass.
