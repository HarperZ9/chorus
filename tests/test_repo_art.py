"""The drawings in the README, held against the code they describe.

The art gate settles whether a drawing fits its columns and matches the spec it
was rendered from. Both sides of that check read the same JSON, so it cannot
settle whether a drawing is TRUE. That is what this file is for: every count,
threshold and rule the three drawings put on the page is asserted here against
the code that produces it, so a claim that stops holding fails the suite rather
than staying on the page. The pipeline already has its own tests beside it, and
nothing here repeats them.
